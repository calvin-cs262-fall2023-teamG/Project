# ChapterCache Project

**ChapterCache: an app for selling and buying used textbooks in Calvin University**

The average college textbook costs an estimated $105.37. This means that Calvin students are looking at around $400 dollars per semester, which is cost heavy.  This is particularly unfortunate because there are other students who still have the textbooks from classes they have previously taken, but there is no way to connect with them. This is where ChapterCache steps in.

While there are some online book stores and facebook pages where people post books they no longer use, those apps can be untrustworthy and target a larger audience and a wider field of books, which makes it difficult to find Calvin-specific textbooks. ChapterCache would have books specific for Calvin courses taught by specific professors which would create a student-centric marketplace exclusively for academic textbooks. It will serve as a go-to place for Calvin students to buy and sell textbooks. We see ChapterCache as a catalyst for creating a network of support and collaboration where students share their resources and build a community that focuses more on studying than the logistics of finding affordable textbooks. 

Together, letâ€™s bid goodbye to wallet-wincing prices and say hello to a marketplace filled with budget-friendly wisdom!
