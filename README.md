Vision Statement

The average college textbook costs an estimated $105.37. As a college student, affording that amount for each of our classes is difficult. It becomes especially annoying when you know that people have taken that class before and they probably have a copy of the exact same book that they no longer use! But is there a good way to connect to those people who have already taken the class?
Yes, while there are some online book stores and facebook pages where people post books they no longer use, most of them are generic, untrustworthy, and are definitely not Calvin specific. This is where ChapterCache comes in! Our app would have the books specifically for Calvin courses taught by specific professors which would create a student-centric marketplace exclusively for academic textbooks. It will serve as a go-to place for Calvin students to buy and sell coursebooks. We see ChapterCache as a catalyst to create a student network of support and collaboration where they share their resources which would ensure students focus more on studies rather than the logistics of finding affordable books.
Together, letâ€™s bid goodbye to wallet wincing prices and say hello to a marketplace filled with budget-friendly wisdom!
